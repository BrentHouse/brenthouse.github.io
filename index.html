Christ hath made us free,” that in his worship different forms
and usages may without offense be allowed, provided the substance
of the Faith be kept entire; and that, in every Church, what cannot
be clearly determined to belong to Doctrine must be referred to Discipline;
and therefore, by common consent and authority, may be altered, abridged,
enlarged, amended, or otherwise disposed of, as may seem most convenient
for the edification of the people, “according to the various exigency of times
and occasions.”</p><h3>Concerning the Service of the Church</h3><p>The Holy Eucharist, the principal act of Christian worship on the Lord’s Day
and other major Feasts, and Daily Morning and Evening Prayer, as set forth
in this Book, are the regular services appointed for public worship in the Church.</p><p>In addition to these services and the other rites contained in this Book,
other forms set forth by authority within this Church may be used.
Also, subject to the direction of the bishop, special devotions taken
from this Book, or from Holy Scripture, may be used when the needs
of the congregation so require.</p><p>For special days of fasting or thanksgiving, appointed by civil or Church authority,
and for other special occasions for which no service or prayer has been provided
in this Book, the bishop may set forth such forms as are fitting to the occasion.</p><p>In all services, the entire Christian assembly participates in such a way
that the members of each order within the Church, lay persons, bishops, priests,
and deacons, fulfill the functions proper to their respective orders,
as set forth in the rubrical directions for each service.</p></main></body></html>
