>Bio</summary><p
>Stacy was born in the Midwest and raised on both the East and West Coasts.
She attended Seattle University, where the Jesuits taught her to love
both God and the intellect.
She earned Bachelor’s degrees in Humanities and German.</p><p
>After traveling and studying Spanish in Central America,
Stacy attended Union Theological Seminary in New York City,
graduating with a Masters of Divinity in 1992.
She spent a year of her studies at the Seminario Bíblico Latinamericano
in San José, Costa Rica, working closely with Episcopal and Lutheran
missions in that city.
After graduating, she worked for five years as the Coordinator of
Volunteer Programs at Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen,
the largest private emergency feeding program in New York City.
She was ordained to the diaconate and priesthood in the
Diocese of New York in 1998.</p><p
>From 1999 to 2004, Stacy worked as Assistant to the Rector at
St. Luke’s Episcopal Church in Kalamazoo, Michigan,
where she was in charge of coordinating the youth and pastoral care programs.
While in Kalamazoo she revived a dormant campus ministry at both
Western Michigan University and Kalamazoo College
and was involved with the Diocesan Evangelism Committee.</p><p
>Stacy has been the Chaplain at Brent House since January 2005.
This vibrant ministry provides a spiritual home for Episcopalians
and other spiritual seekers and offers a space in which the
life of the spirit and the life of the mind can not only co-exist,
but support each other.</p><p
>Stacy has a son who is a college graduate and a daughter in college.
In her free time, she enjoys hanging out with her husband and whichever
children happen to be home, drinking wine with friends, dancing
(swing and Latin), knitting, and singing sad Irish ballads and
Latin American protest songs.</p></details></div><div class="leadership-person"
