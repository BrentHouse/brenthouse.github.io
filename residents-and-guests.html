>Resident Community</h3><p
>Brent House has an active ministry with undergraduates,
graduate students, and other University community members,
with the house itself being an integral part of that ministry,
providing a safe, welcoming, and nourishing place for meetings,
prayer and worship, studying, and community.
We have a community of seven residents who help to support
our programming and hospitality.</p><p
>The resident community:</p><ul
><li
>Shares a meal with other residents twice a month;</li><li
>Actively supports the hospitality of Brent House; and</li><li
>Participates with other residents in outreach and
ministry activities with the graduate student community.</li></ul><p
>Residents need not be Episcopalian or necessarily Christian,
but they do need to be comfortable living in and working with
a ministry that is explicitly both.</p><p
>The resident facilities include a spacious single room with ample closet space
and a discreet vanity sink within the room.
Baths are shared with 1&ndash;3 others and guests.
All utilities except telephone service are included in the monthly rent.
Wireless internet is available throughout the house.
Solid-state ceiling fans and cross ventilation in each room ensure comfort
in all except the most extreme heat; for a modest monthly utilities charge,
residents are allowed to use their own air conditioners.
An additional storage area in the attic is designated for each resident’s use
and bike storage is allowed in the basement.
Kitchen privileges, including cupboard storage and refrigerator space,
are extended to residents.
In addition to the living room and sunroom, there are lounge areas
in the basement and on the fourth floor which provide temporary space
for quiet study or relaxation when the main floor of the house
is in use for programs.
Rents are competitive and comparable to similar facilities in the neighborhood.</p><h3

hosts many public meetings and worship services each week.

a warm and welcoming hospitality.</p><p
